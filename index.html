    <h3><em>What is CSS?</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li>
        <li><span class="item-li-1">Css is not neccesary</span> <span class="item-li-2">CSS saves a lot of work.</span>
            It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <li id="item-li-4">External stylesheets are stored in css files</u></em></li>
    </ol>
    <h1>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways :</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files . However,<span
                class="item-li-2">in this tutorial we
                will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID ,the differece is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID ,on the
        other hand ,applied a style to unique element .ID is also special URL to link directly to an element and it's
        used by JavaScript </p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has
        been targeted, a style can be applied to the element. </p>
    <p>There ia a wide range of selectors available . Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to
        target elements to which a style should be applied </p>
